## ⚙️ Features

- **3 Degrees of Freedom**: Base rotation (360°), main arm elevation (180°), and whisk oscillation for realistic motion
- **Arduino WiFi Uno Control**: Runs motion sequences and enables real-time communication
- **React Dashboard**: Built with React for intuitive control and live visualization of whisking states
- **IoT Connectivity**: Remote command interface using the Adafruit_PWMServoDriver library for smooth, synchronous motion
- **Demonstration Mode**: Preprogrammed whisking patterns optimized for speed and foam texture

## 🧪 How It Works

1. **Input Control** — User adjusts whisking speed and duration via the React dashboard
2. **Signal Processing** — Commands are sent to the Arduino through Wi-Fi
3. **Servo Actuation** — The base, main arm, and whisk motors execute synchronized motions
4. **Feedback Loop** — System can be calibrated to maintain consistency across batches

## ☁️ Inspiration

Inspired by _chanoyu_ (the Japanese tea ceremony), this project bridges modern automation with traditional craftsmanship—transforming the act of whisking into both a cultural and engineering showcase.
